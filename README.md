# TV-Zone

> TV Zone is a website that displays information about TV shows. It also allows you to like the shows, comment on the shows, and make reservations.

The likes, comments and reservations are being preserved in the external [Involvement API](https://www.notion.so/Involvement-API-869e60b5ad104603aa6db59e08150270).
